## About PractiVuln

I'm creating PractiVuln because nowadays technologies had a much vulnerable application, then I was thinking if myself able to help people understanding their software security flaws and supporting each other to defend their self. this project is not just a course but also study for somebody that might find new security flaws and we try to repair it with the community so we can protect each other.
